# Head to Head sample app

This sample app displays tennis players stats read from GraphQL

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
which really helps when time matters.

Data fetching is done with Apollo Client with a very minimal loading and error handling

UI sucks, sorry for that, I'm not really good at this and I tried to focus on making the app to complete (almost) its requirements.

Tests are uncomplete (e.g PlayerList & AppoloClient) but I tried to write major ones. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
